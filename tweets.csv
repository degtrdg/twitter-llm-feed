@levelsio,"Alibaba just released ReplaceAnything on Hugging Face

ReplaceAnything as you want: Ultra-high quality content replacement

demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/modelscope/ReplaceAnything

## AIGC techniques have attracted lots of attention recently. They have demonstrated strong capabilities in the areas of image editing, image generation and so on. We find that generating new contents while strictly keeping the identity of use-specified object unchanged is of great demand, yet challenging. To this end, we propose ReplaceAnything framework. It can be used in many scenes, such as human replacement, clothing replacement, background replacement, and so on



My favorite thing when seeing angry reviews on Nomad List about cities is checking their OTHER reviews

In this case, a person doesn't want you to visit their country, but the same person love to lives in other countries as a digital nomad for years themselves

A pattern I keep seeing is that the most xenophobic people are actually people traveling and living abroad themselves, it's some psychological concept of self hatred I think

I don't just see this once, I see this all the time, in another angry review (pic 2) the person writing is a foreigner who is a DN and moved to the country themselves too but is now complaining essentially about themselves 🤯

I know there's a similar concept with immigrants, once they move to a place, they become conservative and they want immigration to stop. Immigrants are often the most conservative anti immigration of a population!

Chatbot Arena is a unique LLM benchmark that
(1) captures the elusive ""in-the-wild vibe"" to some degree;
(2) live updated and adaptive;
(3) relatively hard to game.
It works like democracy: people vote for their preferred models on the prompts they actually care about. Unlike traditional benchmarks, it is difficult to ""train on the test set"" or overfit a particular prompt distribution. Arena is scalable by design: its accuracy improves as more models and users participate.

ELO score is another clever metric. Just like in chess tournaments, difference in ELO score reflects how consistently a model A's response is better than model B given the same prompt. Unlike static benchmarks that lose potency over time, ELO score cannot be saturated. GPT-9 and Gemini-8 might both score 99.9% on MMLU, but they will still have meaningful ELO scores that show their relative strengths.

There are limitations to this Arena approach:
(1) Noisy: many people are just lazy to examine the outputs carefully.
(2) Biased: the democracy is not representative of the general population. It's skewed to people who know what HuggingFace is.
(3) Hard to evaluate certain capabilities: for example, it's really difficult to rank a model's coding skills by human preferences. More automated ways are better, e.g. with compiler in the loop.

It's remarkable that both Mistral's commercial model (Medium) and open-source one (Mixtral-8x7B) climb the ranks this rapidly. Would love to see more players in the Arena!

In 1939, physicists discussed voluntarily adopting secrecy in atomic physics. Reading Rhodes' book, one can hear three ""camps"":

- Caution
- Scientific Humility
- Openness Idealism

## I feel like these are the same camps I hear in discussion of AI (eg. open sourcing models).

Really cool. If we look the t-SNE of the value projections of tokens in layer 0, there is already a lot of semantic clustering going on. I.e., if you sample from token 'account', the resulting token is closer to the meaning of 'details' and 'records' even in layer 0"
