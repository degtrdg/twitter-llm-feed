"I'm on twitter to see ideas that are relevant to my current work. I don't want to be nerd-sniped by things that aren't relevant though. Judge on the content rather than the presentation of these.

These are some of the things that I'm interested in:
- AI x Biology/Healthcare 
- Applications of multimodal transformer models and improvements to them
    - ex. LLM agent that uses vision to perform tasks on web browsers through screenshots
- Using LLMs to create new interfaces
    - ex. turning text into a graph or flow chart
- Startup launches
    - ex. Anything in tech and if they have funding
- Breakthroughs that are related to projects in my backlogs
    - AI text games combined with spaced repetition like Zork
    - Generating out-of-distribution ideas with LLMs
    - Music Generation

I'm NOT interested in:
- Politics, culture, drama, news
    - Basically, things that I have no control over and won't help me
- AI Safety, Diffusion models
- Research that is too technical and not DIRECTLY useable to my current work
    - ex. novel loss functions, pre-training hacks, large-scale training
    - there is a lot of machine learning research coming out and most of it isn't useable or relevant to the work I'm doing
- Time sinks that take me away from my work
    - I get nerd-sniped often, and it's one of the biggest things I need help with. If something doesn't fit the interested criteria, please shield me from getting nerd-sniped.

User: _akhaliq Transform Screenshots into HTML Code!
The@huggingfacemultimodal team released Websight, a dataset of 823,000 pairs of website screenshots and HTML/CSS code. ü§Ø¬†
Websight is designed to train Vision Language Models (VLMs) to convert images into code.

The dataset was generated using open models and can be used commercially. It includes a simple website and components. The Team also fine-tuned an open model, which you can try for free on Hugging Face.

Model:huggingface.co/HuggingFaceM4‚Ä¶Dataset:huggingface.co/datasets/Hugg‚Ä¶Demo:huggingface.co/spaces/Huggin‚Ä¶It's not perfect yet, but its another huge step forward for more accessibility for VLM. Big kudos to@SanhEstPasMoi@HugoLaurencon@LeoTronchonü§ó

User: emollick Given that they are now for sale, here are brief reviews of the Microsoft Copilot Pro Apps I have tried:

Outlook: This is the slickest of the Copilots in terms of deep integration into the core application, and in many ways is the most obvious use case. It basically lets GPT-4 answer and summarize your emails. It does a nice job drafting email replies (though watch out for hallucinations), but I just wish it handled appointments and scheduling.

Word: Friendlier (but less powerful) way to get ChatGPT-4 to do writing for you. This may end up being the big hit of the Pro apps, since a lot of people seem to not realize the power of GPT-4 as a writing tool, and Word makes it obvious. If you are a ChatGPT-4 power user, you will probably turn to that, instead, but it works quite well.

PowerPoint: Technically, the most impressive Copilot is the one in PowerPoint: the ability to create a fully illustrated draft presentation directly from a document (with speaker notes!), though the presentations are not that exciting. How and when people use it will be fascinating. I wonder whether the ease of creating solid presentations will make PowerPoint more common, or break its hold over offices everwhere.

Excel: It doesn't do much right now, and has many limitations. That is especially disappointing as Excel supports Python, and GPT-4 does Python and data stuff really well. Lots of potential to change the nature of spreadsheets, but no real use case today.

OneNote: I have played with this least, so have little to say.

All-in-all, it is a pretty impressive set of tools, especially if you are not a GPT-4 power user. It is also clear that the easy UXs built into everyone's most used office tools will make AI generated content ubiquitous, for better or worse.

",/emollick/status/1747091793445863713#m,"Based on your interests and preferences, here is my analysis of the tweet:

The tweet seems to discuss the performance gap between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, highlighting that the gap is much larger than what is implied by calling it ""accelerated performance."" Additionally, it mentions Microsoft's lack of explanation regarding educational, non-profit, and worldwide discounts or access.

Based on your interests, this tweet does not directly relate to AI x Biology/Healthcare, applications of multimodal transformer models, using LLMs to create new interfaces, startup launches, or breakthroughs related to your projects. It also does not fall under the category of politics, culture, drama, or news, which you are not interested in.

However, it does touch on AI research and the performance of GPT models, which may be relevant to your work. It is not clear if the tweet contains technical details or if it is a time sink that could potentially nerd-snipe you.

Considering the tweet's content and your preferences, I would lean towards showing you this tweet to keep you informed about advancements in AI research. However, please be cautious and evaluate whether it aligns with your specific interests and if it has the potential to distract you from your work.",yes

Bing/Copilot, which previously offered GPT-4 access for free, is going to limit free GPT-4 to ""non-peak times,"" whatever that means. For many people worldwide, $20/month is a huge barrier

"I'm on twitter to see ideas that are relevant to my current work. I don't want to be nerd-sniped by things that aren't relevant though. Judge on the content rather than the presentation of these.

These are some of the things that I'm interested in:
- Actual information/realizations/advice you'd think is worth telling me

I'm NOT interested in:
- Politics, culture, drama, news
    - Basically, things that I have no control over and won't help me
- Content made to catch my attention
    - If it's intended to make me click I don't want to.
- Trends or things that won't matter to me in the long run
- Shitposting

I want you to look at the following tweet and reason whether or not I should see it.
