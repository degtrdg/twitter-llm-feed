"I'm on twitter to see ideas that are relevant to my current work. I don't want to be nerd-sniped by things that aren't relevant though. Judge on the content rather than the presentation of these.

These are some of the things that I'm interested in:
- AI x Biology/Healthcare 
- Applications of multimodal transformer models and improvements to them
    - ex. LLM agent that uses vision to perform tasks on web browsers through screenshots (NOT normal transformer applications)
- Using LLMs to create new interfaces
    - ex. turning text into a graph or flow chart
- Startup launches
    - Only if they say how much they got funding (ex. Series A)
- Breakthroughs that are related to projects in my backlogs
    - AI text games combined with spaced repetition like Zork
    - Generating out-of-distribution ideas with LLMs
    - Music Generation

I'm NOT interested in:
- Politics, culture, drama, news
    - Basically, things that I have no control over and won't help me
- Image creation models (ex. stable diffusion, midjourney, etc)
    - I am not working on craeting images right now
- Research that is not DIRECTLY useable to my current work and theoretical
    - ex. novel loss functions, pre-training hacks, large-scale training
    - Everything akhaliq posts is about AI so that is NOT a good reason in itself for reccomending a post. A lot of the machine learning research coming out isn't useable or relevant to the work I'm doing
- Time sinks that take me away from my work
    - I get nerd-sniped often, and it's one of the biggest things I need help with. If something doesn't fit the interested criteria, please shield me from getting nerd-sniped.

I want you to look at the following tweet and reason whether or not I should see it. Be very critical and sure if you decide to reccomend something to the user. They don't have time to waste.

User: _akhaliq SHINOBI: Shape and Illumination using Neural Object Decomposition via BRDF Optimization In-the-wild

paper page:huggingface.co/papers/2401.1…present SHINOBI, an end-to-end framework for the reconstruction of shape, material, and illumination from object images captured with varying lighting, pose, and background. Inverse rendering of an object based on unconstrained image collections is a long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics and requires a joint optimization over shape, radiance, and pose. We show that an implicit shape representation based on a multi-resolution hash encoding enables faster and robust shape reconstruction with joint camera alignment optimization that outperforms prior work. Further, to enable the editing of illumination and object reflectance (i.e. material) we jointly optimize BRDF and illumination together with the object's shape. Our method is class-agnostic and works on in-the-wild image collections of objects to produce relightable 3D assets for several use cases such as AR/VR, movies, games, etc.

User: _akhaliq VMamba: Visual State Space Model

paper page:huggingface.co/papers/2401.1…Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) stand as the two most popular foundation models for visual representation learning. While CNNs exhibit remarkable scalability with linear complexity w.r.t. image resolution, ViTs surpass them in fitting capabilities despite contending with quadratic complexity. A closer inspection reveals that ViTs achieve superior visual modeling performance through the incorporation of global receptive fields and dynamic weights. This observation motivates us to propose a novel architecture that inherits these components while enhancing computational efficiency. To this end, we draw inspiration from the recently introduced state space model and propose the Visual State Space Model (VMamba), which achieves linear complexity without sacrificing global receptive fields. To address the encountered direction-sensitive issue, we introduce the Cross-Scan Module (CSM) to traverse the spatial domain and convert any non-causal visual image into order patch sequences. Extensive experimental results substantiate that VMamba not only demonstrates promising capabilities across various visual perception tasks, but also exhibits more pronounced advantages over established benchmarks as the image resolution increases.

User: _akhaliq CustomVideo: Customizing Text-to-Video Generation with Multiple Subjects

paper page:huggingface.co/papers/2401.0…Customized text-to-video generation aims to generate high-quality videos guided by text prompts and subject references. Current approaches designed for single subjects suffer from tackling multiple subjects, which is a more challenging and practical scenario. In this work, we aim to promote multi-subject guided text-to-video customization. We propose CustomVideo, a novel framework that can generate identity-preserving videos with the guidance of multiple subjects. To be specific, firstly, we encourage the co-occurrence of multiple subjects via composing them in a single image. Further, upon a basic text-to-video diffusion model, we design a simple yet effective attention control strategy to disentangle different subjects in the latent space of diffusion model. Moreover, to help the model focus on the specific object area, we segment the object from given reference images and provide a corresponding object mask for attention learning. Also, we collect a multi-subject text-to-video generation dataset as a comprehensive benchmark, with 69 individual subjects and 57 meaningful pairs. Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study results demonstrate the superiority of our method, compared with the previous state-of-the-art approaches.

User: _akhaliq Google presents Rethinking FID

Towards a Better Evaluation Metric for Image Generation

paper page:huggingface.co/papers/2401.0…As with many machine learning problems, the progress of image generation methods hinges on good evaluation metrics. One of the most popular is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). FID estimates the distance between a distribution of Inception-v3 features of real images, and those of images generated by the algorithm. We highlight important drawbacks of FID: Inception's poor representation of the rich and varied content generated by modern text-to-image models, incorrect normality assumptions, and poor sample complexity. We call for a reevaluation of FID's use as the primary quality metric for generated images. We empirically demonstrate that FID contradicts human raters, it does not reflect gradual improvement of iterative text-to-image models, it does not capture distortion levels, and that it produces inconsistent results when varying the sample size. We also propose an alternative new metric, CMMD, based on richer CLIP embeddings and the maximum mean discrepancy distance with the Gaussian RBF kernel. It is an unbiased estimator that does not make any assumptions on the probability distribution of the embeddings and is sample efficient. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that FID-based evaluations of text-to-image models may be unreliable, and that CMMD offers a more robust and reliable assessment of image quality.

User: yacineMTB FAIR's mission is to develop the science and technology for human-level AI assistants: machines that understand the world, can perceive, remember, reason, plan, and act.

In the not-to-distant future, all of our interactions with the digital world will be mediated by AI assistants through our smart glasses and other devices.
We need these systems to have human-level intelligence if they are to understand the world, people, and tools, so as to help us in our daily lives.

To accelerate progress, FAIR is now a sister organization of GenAI, the AI product division.
Simultaneously, Meta is building a massive computing infrastructure to support AI research, development, and production.

Of course, we are committed to open research and open source AI platforms (yes, Llama-3 is coming!)
FAIR is quite simply the best place in the world to advance AI research to the next level, and Meta is the best place in the world to get it in the hands of billions of people.

User: emollick I suppose some of the ""AI is hype"" arguments refer to whether or not AGI is possible, but we don't need AGI for large-scale changes to the nature of work and education. GPT-4 would be enough (and it isn't the end of LLM development).

We should focus more on those implications.

User: emollick The thing pushing AI adoption is that it is, for many people, both obviously useful and does work they hate to do. That makes the incentives for personal adoption very high.

So folks worry publicly about ethics or privacy concerns, but they won't go back to a world without AI.

User: emollick Bad bosses often go unchallenged because their abusiveness creates feelings of fear & exhaustion among the people who work for them.

This can lead to a false sense that everyone agrees with the boss, when instead people who have vital perspectives just chose not to speak up.
